    Determines which branches are discovered.
    <dl>
        <dt>Exclude branches that are also filed as PRs</dt>
        <dd>
            If you are discovering origin pull requests, it may not make sense to discover the same changes both as a
            pull request and as a branch.
        </dd>
        <dt>Only branches that are also filed as PRs</dt>
        <dd>
            Similar to discovering pull requests directly, but env.GIT_BRANCH is set to the branch name rather than PR-#,
            and github pull-request checks are not updated.
        </dd>
        <dt>All branches</dt>
        <dd>
            Ignores whether the branch is also filed as a pull request and instead discovers all branches on the
            origin repository.
        </dd>
    </dl>
